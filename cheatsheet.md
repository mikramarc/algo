# Algorithms cheatsheet

## BFS

Concept - explore in "layers". Typically implemented on a **queue**. For unweighted graphs only. Both directed and undirect graphs allowed.

Applications:
- shortest path
- full connectivity
- MST
- bipartite graph
- cycle detection
- path finding

## DFS

Concept - go as deep as possible into the graph and backtrack. Typically implemented on a **stack**. For unweighted graphs only. Both directed and undirect graphs allowed.

Applications:
- cycle detection
- path finding
- topological sorting
- bipartite graph
- strongly connected components
- maze solving
- full conectivity
